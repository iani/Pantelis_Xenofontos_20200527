-Yeah… I was talking before, before the talk today, I was talking about the different ways we approach sound and image, right? I was saying this isn’t something kind of unique to me but the way in which the visual… let’s say modern, experimental, whatever we wanna call it, contemporary, visual art it’s something that’s like… a tourist attraction in any city… right?... the biggest tourist venues in any city are gonna be the modern contemporary art museum and how that’s still now quite the same with sound and image. One of the folks I was talking to suggested maybe that has to do with the fact… you may be eluded to that sound is still alerts us to danger in a certain way that image maybe, of course the image does this but sound makes us… you know…and so the question is... is anything that’s gonna be noisy… or that its gonna alert us in that way always gonna put us in a place of kinda of discomfort… But the question of… I do think that so much of what’s going on over the last…  (now someone could say it’s always been there) but over the last 40-50 years it is an attention to listening and I do think that… people like John Cage, people like Pauline Oliveros or some I didn’t mention, Pauline Oliveros who says this is great practice of deep listening and when you start… you know… kind of living on a sonic world you start hearing your world really differently, things that… peoples refrigerators start to be super interesting, and peoples you know subways… what I mean it’s like that’s really fascinating and… what Cage did, by shifting attention from foreground to background really did that so in our everyday lives… so… sort of look out for these things and then in a certain sense I think this is what we wanted we become artists in that sense so far as we select and we shape a set of things like … that’s fascinating, that’s interesting and I think Murray Schafer, one of the later guys I mentioned, thought that maybe we can actually begin to design our sound world in a way… it isn’t sometimes… it isn’t designed, we design our… we design our visual world, but we don’t always design our sonic world and that’s… you know… maybe at our peril. I don’t know if that answered the question... Thanks. Yeah…

-Hi… so it seems like that the technology that tape recorder has inspired a lot creativity from tape loops of minimalism to sound recording, but it doesn’t seem like that the Internet and mobile technology have inspired creativity, they’ve changed the way we distribute music and so on, but I mean they have inspired artists do they lead to creative kind of ideas?
